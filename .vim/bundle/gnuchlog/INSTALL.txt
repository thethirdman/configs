To install and use this plugin:

 - Set the EMAIL environment to your email address, e.g., 
   export EMAIL="John Doe <jdoe@foo.com>".  This is the user name
   that will be included in the changelog entry.

 - Copy plugin/gnuchlog.vim to your ~/.vim/plugin dir.

 - Copy ftplugin/changelog.vim to your ~/.vim/ftplugin dir.  This
   overrides the changelog.vim included by default in vim.

 - Make sure you have "filetype plugin on" in your .vimrc

If you want to auto-include class/method/function name in the
ChangeLog entry using the pythonhelper.py plugin:
   
 - Copy plugin/pythonhelper.vim to your ~/.vim/plugin dir if you don't
   have it already, which will give you this info in the status
   line all by itself.
   
 - Copy the ftplugin/python_gnuchlog.vim script to your ~/.vim/ftplugin
   dir to make the gnuchlog.vim plugin use the pythonhelper.vim info
   to get the class/method/name.

 - You can override the statusline setting to your liking by adding a
   'set stl' command to ~/.vim/after/plugin/pythonhelper.vim.  See
   ':help statusline' for info on how to configure the status line.
   For example:

   set stl=%-f%r\ %2*%m%*%h%w\ %1*%{TagInStatusLine()}%*%=%l,%c%V
